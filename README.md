## Snapshots

All changes committed to master are automatically released as snapshots.

To add a snapshot dependency to your builds, make sure you add the snapshot repository so your build system can look up the dependency.

Maven users can add the following to their `pom.xml`:
```
<repository>
    <id>ossrh</id>
    <name>Sonatype Snapshot Repository</name>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
    <releases>
        <enabled>false</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
</repository>
```

Gradle users should declare this in their repositories block:
```
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
  maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/' }
}
```

# Open-Source at Astronomer

One of our core values at Astronomer is "openness." We see this manifest in our dedication to open-source. We are relentless to **only invent what we must invent**; to use and contribute to the large and growing body of open-source software that countless developers have selflessly contributed to the world.

And it's not just about receiving value. Open-source is a two-way street. A core element of our business strategy is to open-source the [Aries Framework](github.com/aries-data), with the goal to reduce the amount of time developers waste re-writing integrations.

We also have many open-source projects in [our main Github organization](https://github.com/astronomerio).

## Special Notice re: Analytics.js and Segment

Early on, in order to get clickstream data collection capability quickly within our platform, and after a conversation with Peter Reinhart (an early Analytics.js contributor and CEO of Segment), we decided to adopt Analytics.js to support it as a standard for clickstream data collection. As Segment has built a successful commercial venture around the core library, they've open-sourced a number of supporting plugins and SDKs that we've also adopted.

Clickstream is one part of Astronomer, and an important one to our early customers. We publicly thank Segment for their open-source contributions, it made it easier to stand up that part of our platform. In appreciation and in the spirit of our cooperation, we open-source all of our Analytics.js-related code, contributing back to a growing ecosystem.
